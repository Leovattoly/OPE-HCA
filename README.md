# OPE-HCA
OPE-HCA: an optimal probabilistic estimation approachfor hierarchical clustering algorithm

THIS CODE IS AN IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ALGORITHM PROPOSED IN THE UPLOADED PAPER.


Hierarchical   clustering   algorithm   (HCA) is   on   of   the   best   method   using   in   data   mining.   Itproposes  two  different  types  of  method  to  discover  thehidden  patterns  in  a  given  data  set.  Agglomerate  andDivisive  methods  are  the  methods  proposed  by  HCA.However, clustering algorithms are facing two differentdrawbacks: the use of distance based approach and thedifficulty  while  integrating  two  local  clusters.  We  caneasily optimize any clustering algorithm by reducing thedrawbacks. In this paper we are introducing a GeneticsAlgorithm  (GA)  based  approach  to  integrate  the  localclusters,and  optimize  HCA.  Introducing  ”The  survivalof  the  fittest”  technique,  to  optimize  the  AgglomerateHCA   algorithm.   Here   we   are   including   GA   usingprobabilistic method, exploring the data set and findingthe fittest local cluster using Estimation of DistributionAlgorithm  (EDA),  and  generating  the  next  generationusing  Optimal  Probabilistic  Estimation  (OPE).  OPE-HCA showing better performance, also increased abilityto  searching  and  discovering  the  hidden  patterns.
